Hello, this is Miguel, usually go by Immac or ImmacHn online; this is my GitHub Pages site. At the moment it is rather empty, but I will be looking forward to filling it with plenty of interesting things.

## About Me

I'm just a normal man who likes to do a lot of different things, a true _Jack of All Trades_. I like to think of myself as highly adaptable and curious, but pragmatic. I do activities such as illustration, both manual and generated. I also do game design and development, be it video games or tabletop games, speedrunning (I actually hold a few World Records, [check them out here](https://www.speedrun.com/users/Immac)). I'm also on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ImmacHn). I like programming and designing tools, especially when it comes to back-end development. I can do front-end as well, it's just that I prefer back-end development.

## Projects

- TBD (Please check out my GitHub for projects, standout projects will be added at a later date)

## Contact

Feel free to reach out to me on [GitHub](https://github.com/immac) or via email at [my Gmail](immac.gm+homepage@gmail.com).

## Blog

Stay tuned for upcoming blog posts where I will share my thoughts on whatever I'm doing at the moment.
