Hello, this is Miguel, usually go by Immac or ImmacHn online; this is my GitHub Pages site. I look forward to filling this page with plenty of interesting things.

## About Me

I'm a highly adaptable and curious Jack of All Trades. I enjoy various activities like manual and generated illustration, game design and development (both video games and tabletop games), and speedrunning. I even hold a few World Records, [which you can check out here](https://www.speedrun.com/users/Immac)). I'm also on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ImmacHn). I like programming and designing tools, especially when it comes to back-end development. I can do front-end as well, it's just that I prefer back-end development.

## Some Interesting Points

- [Touhou Spirit Clash](https://immac.github.io/touhou-spirit-clash-docs/):[Card Maker](https://github.com/Immac/touhou-spirit-clash-card-maker). [This](https://github.com/Immac/touhou-spirit-clash-card-maker) is a Card Maker for a Trading Card Game I'm developing sporadically, the maker is currently available at [Itch.io](https://immac.itch.io/touhou-tcg-maker), the Desktop version is recommended, but the mobile versions are usable.

- I made the ComftyUI's Dev and Offtopic matrix channel's pictures:
