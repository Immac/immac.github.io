Hello, this is Miguel, usually go by Immac or ImmacHn online, this is my GitHub Pages site. At the moment it is rather empty, but I will be looking forward to filling it with plenty of interesting things.

## About Me

I'm just a normal man who likes to do a lot of different things, a true Jack of All trades. I like to think of myself as highly adaptable and curious, but pragmatic. I do activities such as illustration, both manual and generated. Game design and development, be it video games or tabletop games. Speedrunning (I actually hold a few World Records, [check it out here](https://www.speedrun.com/users/Immac)). I'm also on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ImmacHn). I like programming and designing tools, especially when it comes to bac-kend development, I can do front-end as well, it's just that I prefer back-end development.

## Projects
