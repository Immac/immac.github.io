[This](https://civitai.green/models/1270913/golden-legends) is the merge I've used most for SD 1.5. It has a mix of Cartoon and Anime. Very soupy but can do some good stuff and knows a couple of Touhou Project characters. It's good with Touhou LORA as well. I don't remember the exact merge but it's about 70~80% Convergenge.LegendsNeverDie and the rest GoldenCatCitron. Uploading here mostly for completeness sake.

Workflows for ComfyUI embedded, I tried to make simple workflows that show mostly what the model can do without too much hassle, of course you can add more upscaling and details and LORA and whatnot. I'm not a fan of not being able to replicate the results of models due to them adding so much extra on top that you can't really tell if it was the model or all the other stuff that made the picture.
